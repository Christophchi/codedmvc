// Automatically Instantiating Global Middleware
// During the application bootstrapping process, the code iterates through the middleware files within the designated directory.
// For each middleware file found, it includes the file and checks for classes defined within it.
// Upon discovering these classes, the code instantiates each one, checking if they possess an 'isGlobal' property set to 'true'.
// If the 'isGlobal' property is 'true', the middleware instance is stored for global availability throughout the application.
// This automatic instantiation ensures that global middleware logic is available across all application endpoints.

// new Shopmiddleware(); //Do not uncomment this line to avoid creating double instances of the middleware class.
